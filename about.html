    <p id="hd">Hi, I'm Siddharth Jai Gokulan, just another person hoping to reimagine the world with software. I was born and live in India. I started programming with Scratch when I was 6. It really intruiged me. As of writing this, many years later, I still haven't given up my love for programming.<br>
