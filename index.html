  <p align="center" class="sitehead">Non-canon material unrelated to TFOE that depicts scenes from other books or pop culture media from a different perspective and whose sole purpose is to leave you with more questions than answers.</p>
  <p align="center" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color:white;">The Other Side (Frag Guy, 2028): "I didn't want to do it, but I had no choice. I pulled out the sniper and stood behind the pillar. Just when I was ready to shoot, I was shot in the leg. I screamed, and the man approached me to interrogate me. I was impersonating, so I couldn't give him the details. In a desperate and probably hopeless attempt, I pulled out the frag I had bought at Botha's Firearms. I expected him to shoot again before I pulled the pin off, but he didn't. He ran, but was caught in the blast radius. I felt really guilty about it, but I had no choice. My armour kept me unharmed, but I didn't want to look suspicious or be hunted down, so I used the Mags Industries Sus-machine 2000 to create a corpse of myself, called the police using the man's phone (whose name was apparently Liu Bingwen) and escaped the scene before the cops could arrive."
<p align="center" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color:white;">Johannes Botha, better known as Sgt. Botha of the 15th paratroopers. He would stop at nothing for information and justice. And now, he was after me. The person who had killed his brother fled, and I was the only other person at the site. I had told him exactly that the previous day, but he didn't listen. "You have 24 hours. Tell me the truth or I'll get it the painful way... painful for you." Now I had no choice but to flee. It wasn't my life I cared for, it was my family and friends. Nowhere was safe from him. I could run, but I couldn't hide. Eventually, I had to confront him. And if he didn't believe me then, that would mean the end for me. I had 6 more hours to confront him or die. But I still had hopes of escaping, so I went on. After some searching, I found a black building, isolated from the rest. I carefully went inside and found an escape hatch. I entered and used my compass to navigate and go in the direction of my house. I couldn't escape, so the most I could do was warn the people who cared for me, before they were interrogated. I reached the approximate location of my house through the shaft and entered a similar black room. I looked around, but there was no escape hatch. Then I heard him behind me. "I honestly didn't think you would fall for that." I was cornered. "I'm telling you, it wasn't me! I am merely a witness, the murderer has escaped!" He shot me in the right thigh. "AAAAAAAAARGH!" "Tell me the truth, now." "I am telling the truth! He has escaped!" "What did he look like?" "I don't know, he covered his face and wore a cloak... but he was about 5'5" tall and had a sniper in his hand. His eyes were black. He was thin, and his skin was pale." He pulled a picture out of his wallet and showed it to me. "That's it, that's him!" He cursed under his breath and said, "All for that stupid box." "Go home," he said and handed me $500 in cash. "This should be enough to buy some medical kits. Your family's probably worried about you." Then he turned and left, all while having the same hard expression on his face.</p>
